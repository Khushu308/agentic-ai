# Pydantic AI Agents Exploration 
## Welcome to the Pydantic AI Agents Projects Repository!

This repo contains 5 levels of hands-on projects built with the Pydantic AI framework + Gemini API, demonstrating how to build smart agents that answer questions, remember conversations, search the web, store knowledge, and even mimic Google NotebookLM.

## What is Pydantic AI?
[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a Python framework that helps you build intelligent, multi-capable AI agents using structured workflows.

### It provides:
- Validation & Safety: Ensures clean, validated input/output using Pydantic models.
- Agent Routing: Automatically decides which agent handles which task.
- Tool Integration: Supports tools like Google Search, OCR, and APIs for extended capability.
- Memory & Planning: Enables multi-turn conversations and long-term memory.
- Multi-Agent Coordination: Powers agents that work together, like a full assistant ecosystem.
