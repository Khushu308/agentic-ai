# Pydantic AI Agents Exploration 
## Welcome to the Pydantic AI Agents Projects Repository!

This repo contains 5 levels of hands-on projects built with the Pydantic AI framework + Gemini API, demonstrating how to build smart agents that answer questions, remember conversations, search the web, store knowledge, and even mimic Google NotebookLM.

## Levels and Projects

### Level 1: Basic Hello World Agent
- 💡 A simple agent powered by a language model (LLM) that answers basic queries in the CLI.

### Level 2: Conversational Memory Agent
- 🧠 Learns how to use conversation history to provide better, more relevant answers.

### Level 3: Tool-Enabled Web Search Agent
- 🌐 Integrates a search tool (e.g., Travily Search) to fetch real-time information, like a mini Perplexity.
  
### Level 4: Vector Store & OCR Agent
- 📂 Creates a vector database for resources (e.g., Compiler Design book), processes resumes, and uses OCR to read scanned documents.

### Level 5: Multi-Agent (Notebook LM Mimic)
- 🎙 Combines PDFs, YouTube URLs, web pages, text, and images into a multi-tool AI system. Generates mindmaps and podcasts, mimicking Google NotebookLM’s workflow.
