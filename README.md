# agentic-ai

## Goal

This repo exists to help people to get started with Agentic AI. The idea is to focus on the essentials and not cover any irrelevant material (e.g. how transformers work?). Disagree? Does one need to know how an Internal Combustion Engine works before they learn to drive a car?

## How to use this repo

* Refer to the [sample problem](https://github.com/cladius/agentic-ai/blob/master/sample_problem.md) to understand the 5 level problem.
* Pick the Agentic framework that you want to get your hands dirty with. 
* Then navigate to the corresponding folder and go through the example solutions for the sample 5 level problem.
* Run them as is. Understand them. Then make changes as your heart desires and gain understanding.
* If you feel up to the challenge, make enhancements OR build agentic AI solutions in a different framework and raise a PR for the same 5 level problem.
